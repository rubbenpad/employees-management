## Employees Management System

ðŸ“¢ _This project is in development mode_

This is the front-end layer of a project to manage the information of workers in a company. The purpose is to implement a basic system that allow us to create, read, updated and delete information about the employees.

Through the development of this project I use modern technologies and best practices to write code. The idea is to learn TDD and implement it both in frontend and backend layers with help of Jest. The UI is built with React and styled-components.
