## Employees Management System

ðŸ“¢ _This project is in development mode_

This is the front-end layer of a project to manage the information of workers in a company. The purpose is to implement a basic system that allow us to create, read, updated and delete information about employees.

Through the development of this project I use modern technologies and best practices to write code. The main idea is to apply my knowledge to make both frontend and backend layers and integrate them to delivery a great application that can be scalable an maintainable through time.

**Before you start make sure you have running the API** by default the URI is localhost:4000/graphql. See api folder to run api.

2. Navigate into your new created directory

    `cd employees-management`

3. Install dependencies

    `npm install`

5. Open the source code and makes the magic happen


### Test

1. You can view the source code of implemented tests

    `src/__test__/`

2. Run the test script

    `npm run test`

3. Know the application test coverage

    `npm run test -- --coverage`


### If you want to try the application in production mode:

1. Run the build script
