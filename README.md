## Employees Management System

ðŸ“¢ _This project is in development mode_

This is the front-end layer of a project to manage the information of workers in a company. The purpose is to implement a basic system that allow us to create, read, updated and delete information about employees.

Through the development of this project I use modern technologies and best practices to write code. The main idea is to apply my knowledge to make both frontend and backend layers and integrate them to delivery a great application that can be scalable an maintainable through time.

1. Clone the repository
   
    `git clone git@github.com:rubbenpad/employees-management.git`

    `src/__test__/`

2. Run the test script

    `npm run test`

3. Know the application test coverage

    `npm run test:coverage`
